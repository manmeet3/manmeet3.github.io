   <img src="{{ site.assets }}/eonelesson.jpg" alt="HTML5 Icon" style="width:150;height:150px; margin:13px;border-radius: 2px;"> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Economics-One-Lesson-Shortest-Understand/dp/0517548232">Economics in One Lesson</a> by Hentry Hazlitt
   <p><i> Quick Summary: </i> This book very concisely states that many economical fallacies exist resulting from special interest bias and a neglect of the long-term consequences and their associated varied outcomes. The lesson itself can be best quoted as "The
art of economics consists in looking not merely at the immediate
but at the longer effects of any act or policy; it consists in
tracing the consequences of that policy not merely for one group
but for all groups". </p>
