      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>Hey there! Welcome to my page. I am a recent grad of University of California, Santa Cruz where I majored in Neuroscience and Computer Science. I am mainly interested in software development, smart machines (thought processes) and personalized medicine. Additionally, I also enjoy thinking about all kinds of micro proceses and their relation to the big picture.
      </p>

      <p> In my leisure time, I enjoy playing video games, working out and spending time with friends/family.</p>
