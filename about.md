Hey there! Now that you're here, it's only right that I tell you a bit about myself. 
         
I was born in India and moved to the US at the age of 13. I attended Monta Vista High School in Cupertino, CA. Initially, my goal after high school was to go to college followed by graduate school. Medicine or biology research seemed like appropriate fields where I would be able to explore the connection between our every day seemingly analog lives and how they result from more fundamental physical processes (entropy, thermodynamics). I felt that such an understanding would allow one to re-imagine much of what existed and how it can be improved upon at such a fundamental level that its impact ripples through everything else.

       

Fast forwarding to my junior year in college, I came to the realization that software was changing fast and propelling fundamental change in many of the other areas that affect our daily lives. And so, graduate school seemed to be somewhat of a comfortable approach where I would probably be able to study what I enjoyed and maybe even contribute in research towards the total knowledge in the world. But, what drew me away was the fear that that might be the peak of it and I really wanted to be able to help accelerate some kind of a more direct positive change that had already begun with the development of the internet. 

 
Recently, I graduated from the University of California, Santa Cruz where I majored in Neuroscience and Computer Science. I am mainly interested in software development, smart machines (thought processes) and personalized medicine. Additionally, I also enjoy thinking about how everything works, different micro proceses, and their relation to the big picture.


In my leisure time, I enjoy playing video games (currently csGO and starcraft2), working out and spending time with friends/family.
